# Mongo Data Construction

In order for this app to work as intended you must run the insert-data.js file in order for your mongodb to have the resort data

To do this you must first create a database named **'SkiFinder'** with a collection name **'ski'** and this must be on **localhost:27017** for the insert-data.js file to run correctly.

After doing so you should see the resort data from resorts.csv in your MongoDB

# Install Dependencies

If this is the first time cloning this repository you must run:

### `npm install`

to install all of the required dependencies. You can then follow the instructions below to run the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This has been adjusted from a normal React App by using concurrently to run both the backend on localhost:5000 and the app on localhost:3000

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
